# Chat It Up App

## Overview

Chat It Up is a real-time chat application that enables users to communicate with each other in different chat rooms. The application is built using React for the front end, Node.js with Express for the server, and Socket.IO for real-time communication.

## Description

The project includes various components for handling user authentication, creating and joining chat rooms, and sending and receiving real-time messages. The application utilizes WebSocket communication through Socket.IO, ensuring low-latency and responsive chat interactions.

## Communication Between Layers

- **Frontend and Backend Communication:**
  - The frontend communicates with the backend server through HTTP requests for user authentication and Socket.IO for real-time messaging.

- **Real-time Messaging:**
  - Socket.IO is used for bi-directional communication between the client and server, facilitating real-time messaging.

- **User Authentication:**
  - Passport.js is employed for user authentication and session management.

## Dependencies

- **Frontend:**
  - React: For building the user interface.
  - Material-UI: Styling components and providing a consistent design.
  - Socket.IO Client: Client library for WebSocket communication.

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js with Express: As the server framework.
  - Socket.IO: For real-time, bidirectional communication.
  - Passport.js: For user authentication.
  - MongoDB with Mongoose: Optional, if the application involves persistent data storage.

## Relationship Between Files

- **Frontend:**
  - `ChatRoomComponent.js`: Component for joining and participating in chat rooms.
  - `LoginComponent.js`: Component for user authentication.
  - `ChatApp.js`: Main application component orchestrating other components.

- **Backend:**
  - `server.js`: Entry point for the Node.js server.
  - `socketHandler.js`: Handles WebSocket connections and real-time messaging.
  - `authHandler.js`: Manages user authentication using Passport.js.
  - `database.js`: Optional file for interacting with MongoDB using Mongoose.

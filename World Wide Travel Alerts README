# World Wide Travel Alerts

## Overview

World Wide Travel Alerts is a full-stack application that allows users to manage and view travel advisories and alerts globally. The application is built using React for the front end, Fastify as the server, and MongoDB as the database.

## Description

The project consists of different components for handling various aspects of travel advisories. It includes features such as adding advisories, listing advisories, and setting up alerts. The application utilizes GraphQL for communication between the client and server, enabling efficient data retrieval and updates.

## Communication Between Layers

- **Frontend and Backend Communication:**
  - The frontend communicates with the backend server through GraphQL queries and mutations.
  - GraphQL allows for efficient and flexible communication, reducing over-fetching or under-fetching of data.

- **Database Interaction:**
  - MongoDB is used as the database to store travel advisory information.
  - The server communicates with the MongoDB database using the official MongoDB Node.js driver.

## Dependencies

- **Frontend:**
  - React: For building the user interface.
  - Material-UI: Styling components and providing a consistent design.
  - React Query: For handling server-side data fetching.

- **Backend:**
  - Fastify: As the server framework.
  - Mercurius: GraphQL plugin for Fastify.
  - MongoDB Driver: Official MongoDB driver for Node.js.
